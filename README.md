## **🛠 How It Works**

### **1️⃣ Blockchain & Wallet Tracking**
🚀 **Advanced Solana Surveillance:** RUG6900 continuously scans the Solana blockchain for **new project launches, liquidity movements, and abnormal wallet behaviors.** Our AI-powered algorithms **flag suspect activity** and **track wallets linked to past scams.**  
📊 **On-Chain Behavior Analysis:** Using **historical transaction data**, we identify **patterns of rug pulls, wash trading, and coordinated dumps.**  
⚡ **Instant Alerts:** As soon as a wallet is flagged, our system updates the **RUG INDEX**, ensuring **real-time fraud detection.**  

### **2️⃣ The Immutable Rug Index**
🔗 **Permanent Records:** Once a scammer is indexed, they **can’t erase their history**—their fraud is stored **forever** on **IPFS and decentralized databases.**  
⚖ **Community-Verified Listings:** Our fraud detection system **relies on data, but verification comes from the community.** Reports and AI signals work **hand-in-hand to prevent false positives.**  
👁 **Transparency First:** The **RUG6900 following list = the blacklist.** If we follow you, **you’re indexed for good reason.**  

### **3️⃣ Automated Twitter Exposure**
🤖 **AI-Powered Callouts:** RUG6900 actively monitors Twitter **for influencers promoting rugs, deleting evidence, or misleading their audience.**  
🚨 **Instant Warnings:** If a notable user engages with a flagged account, they receive **automated alerts exposing the scammer.**  
🔥 **Merciless Trolling:** Indexed scammers don’t just get listed—they get relentlessly exposed, ridiculed, and publicly dismantled. Our AI-powered bot floods their tweets with **receipts, past scams, and financial history**, ensuring they never escape accountability. **There is no rebranding away from the index.**  

### **4️⃣ AI-Powered Scam Detection**
🛠 **Allora-Enhanced Intelligence:** We use **Allora AI** to **predict** fraudulent behavior before it happens. AI detects patterns in **wallet activity, influencer marketing schemes, and liquidity movements** to issue **early scam warnings.**  
🎯 **Targeted Tracking:** The system **identifies high-risk wallets** and **flags influencers known for promoting failed projects.**

🔹 **Step 3:** If the AI confirms suspicious activity, the report is flagged for human verification. Once validated, **the scammer is publicly indexed** and earns a follow on X from our agent **permanently tracked.**
